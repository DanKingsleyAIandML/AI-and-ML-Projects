Projects that I have completed to qualify for a remote location data analysis position
I have posted projects on GitHub that use CNNs to classify images of seedling of various plants correctly. I also have posted programs I wrote that analyze bank records data to determine the likelihood of a customerâ€™s purchase of a loan, or their closing their credit card accounts with the bank.
                
Project -1 Project title: CV_8__w_VGG16_full_code.ipynb
Description: Created a CNN model piggybacked on the VGG16 neural network model that classifies images of plant seedlings according to type.
Project -2
Project title: Copy_of_Final.ipynb
Description: Created a data model that analyzed data from a restaurant food delivery service to decide which restaurants it would be profitable to offer discounts to inorder to garner more customers.
Project -3
Project title: Final_MLS2_21_ipynb.ipynb
Description: Created a data model that used banking data to determine the profile of a customer most likely to purchase a loan.
Project -4
Project title: ML_Credit_CardChurn_Prediction_Revision.ipynb
Description: Created a data model that used banking data to determine the profile of a customer most likely to close their credit card account with the bank.
