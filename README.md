Projects that I have completed to qualify for a remote location data analysis position
I have posted projects on GitHub that use CNNs to classify images of seedling of various plants correctly. I also have posted programs I wrote that analyze bank records data to determine the likelihood of a customerâ€™s purchase of a loan, or their closing their credit card accounts with the bank.
